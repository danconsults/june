Welcome to my blog. I mostly write about career, and my interest in Data analysis and Information management
I am also using this site as a guinea-pig as I learn about web-programing usin gRuby and Jekyll. I also 
dabble with django because I am learning to code in pyhton. 

That being said, My first love remains to be the R-statistics language and I shall be posting some interesting 
projects in R. 

you're welcome to comment, and contribute. 

Ps: I am also in the process of setting up a daily data analysis website (startup), where all the data junkies out there 
can share their daily data from any source (e.g running data) in case your are intersted, Kindly let me know.
